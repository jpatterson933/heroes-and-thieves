	"description": "The basic unit is essential to any game, serving as the foundation for more advanced strategies. Its primary role is often to absorb damage, earning it the nickname 'meat for the grinder.' Despite this, the unit can be equipped with powerful weapons, though this relies on luck of the card draw. In close range combat, the unit proves highly versatile, demonstrating formidable defense against warriors of similar strength and mounted units. However, it may struggle against ranged units and those with supernatural abilities, as its defense is comparatively lower. Nevertheless, its close combat proficiency makes it a valuable asset on the battlefield.."
